Before using the python scripts change the path in the following line to your path:

  df = pd.read_excel('/Users/panos/Desktop/WS1819_VISU/dataset/crime_xlsx_all_years.xlsx')

When want to run the script open the terminal/cmd and change to the path the script is:
  "cd path"

  after that run "python scriptname.py" for example "python bubblemap.py"

if you get the error message "module not found" install the module by typing:
pip install "modulename"
